#### How to run?

First you will need to create a python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv lab_env
```

Then activate the new environment:

```bash
source lab_env/bin/activate
```

Once inside the environment, the requirements must be downloaded:

```bash
(lab_env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the `main.py` script:

```bash
(lab_env)$ python3 cbc_mac.py
```
